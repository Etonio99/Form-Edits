This is a tool that adds utility and functionality to editing NexHealth forms.

This is built using NextJS. Run `npm run dev` to start up a development server.

## Usage

This tool is able to edit one page/panel of a form at a time. To start, open a form in NexHealth and click the wrench icon in the top-right corner of the page you want to edit. Then, copy the entire JSON data for that page. In this Form Editor tool, paste the JSON data into the textarea in the top-right corner.

From there, the form will automatically load and display on the left side of the page. Once the form is displayed, you can click on the gear icon in the top-right corner of any component to run utility functions.
